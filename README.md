# Customer Segmentation & Prediction

This project is to achieve customer segmentation and predict the future customer categories of an online business store.

## 1 DataSet
The dataset is download from Kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data . It consists of 8 columns and 541989 rows. 
The meaning of each column is described below:
-	InvoiceNo: Invoice number, represents each unique transaction. 
-	StockCode: Product code, represents each unique product. 
-	Description: Product name. 
-	Quantity: The quantities of each product per transaction. 
-	InvoiceDate: Invoice Date and time, represents the day and time when each transaction was generated. 
-	UnitPrice: Unit price. 
-	CustomerID: Customer number, represents each unique customer.
-	Country: Country name, represents the name of the country where each customer resides.

Product segmentation and customer segmentation are achieved by using K-Means classification method. Features used for product segmentations are based on product names and price ranges. Features used for customer segmentations are customerâ€™s purchase habits and based on the results from product segmentation. 

I applied 10 classification models (SVM (linear), SVM (Gussian), SVM (Polynomial), Decision Tree, LDA, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Random Forest, and KNN) to predict customer categories. 

## 3 Result

- Products are divided into 7 clusters, 
- and customers are divided into 11 groups.

- Linear SVM provides the best accuracy (98%) of predicting customer groups.

More details and results are presented in the Jupyter Notebook.
